## ðŸ”§ Future Customizations

Want to change something? Edit these files:

### Business Settings

- `bot/commands/` - Add new slash commands
- `bot/payments/` - Add new payment methods

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Test locally first**: Make changes in Replit, test with your bot, then push to production
2. **Backup important data**: Railway keeps your database, but export important orders periodically
3. **Monitor your bot**: Check Railway dashboard occasionally to ensure everything's running
4. **Use Discord for 90% of tasks**: Most shop management happens through Discord commands

Your bot is now a professional, always-online business tool!
